# Carousel

## This is a carousel demo for personal practice. I used HTML,CSS and JavaScript to build this one. 

Functions:

  Arrows to switch to previous or next pictures;</br>
  Dots on the bottom to show the index of pictures;</br>
  Click dots to choose specific picture;</br>
  
Notes:</br>
  No other 3rd party frames used;</br>
  Only native JavaScript;</br>
